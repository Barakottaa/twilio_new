# 🔍 Message Flow Trace

## Expected Flow:
1. **WhatsApp Message Sent** → Twilio receives it
2. **Twilio Webhook Called** → `/api/twilio/conversations-events`
3. **Webhook Processes** → Stores in database
4. **SSE Broadcast** → Sends to connected clients
5. **Client Receives** → Updates UI in real-time

## Current Status:
- ✅ Message appears in conversation list (polling works)
- ❌ Message doesn't appear in chat view (real-time broken)

## What to Check:
1. Are webhooks being called?
2. Is SSE broadcasting?
3. Is client receiving SSE events?
4. Is UI updating with new messages?
